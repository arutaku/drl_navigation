# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

For this project, I have trained an agent to navigate and collect bananas.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Installation and execution

I have used Linux. You can download the version for your SO, but remember to point to your Banana environment folder:

```env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Linux/Banana.x86_64")```

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

2. Place the file in the unziped folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file.

3. Create a virtual environment with anaconda and install packages: ```conda env create -f environment.yml```.

4. Activate the virtual environment: ```source activate <name of the env>```.

5. Install more packages:

Due to issues with conda, not only environment.yml is provided. Another file (requirements.txt) is also attached and should be taken into account.

Next with pip: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

6. Launch jupyter notebook: ```jupyter notebook Navigation.ipynb```

7. Execute cells: just first cell (for imports):
```
from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np
```
Then, load the environment (in section number 4 "It's your turn"):

```
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Linux/Banana.x86_64")
```

Finally execute the last cell to run the training and evaluation.

Thank you!
